# Fitness-Tracker
MongoDB Fitness Tracker

The purpose of this project was to build an application that would allow users to save, update, and view data from their workouts. The project user story is below.

```
AS A habitual exerciser

I WANT to be able to view, create, and update my workouts (including number of sets, reps, amount of weight,duration, and multiple exercises per workout) 

SO THAT I can manage my metrics and plan workouts more efficiently.
```

 The criteria for a successful project are below: 

* Application should allow users to add exercises to a previous workout.

* Application should allow users to add new exercises to a new workout. 

* Application should allow users to view combined workout data on a separate "stats" page.

### Development

Below are the steps I took to create the application as it is so far. The most difficult aspects of this application for me were understanding the new syntax for Mongoose and MongoDB, and understanding how to get the charts on the Stats page to work. 

1. Created and linked the initial files (JS files, HTML files, JSON files). 

2. Downloaded all dependecies using npm. 

3. Created and verified all HTML routes.

4. Created and tested API routes with Postman and Robo3T. 

5. Created functions to render API route data onto pages.

6. Troubleshoot the returned data object from API routes to get the desired output.

7. Troubleshoot the charts to represent the real data being inputted. 

## Testing

This application was not developed using Test Driven Development. However, at numerous points throughout development, Postman and console.log's were used to test the results of new elements. 

## Deployment

This program can be viewed and deployed using most internet browsers via the links in the "Getting Started" section.
